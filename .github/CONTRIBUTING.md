## How to Contribute

The code for the library is housed in `src/app/ng-intercom`. The rest of the code in this codebase is for testing purposes, to help you see if the library is working as expected before openning a pull request.

We're always open to new ideas on how we can make this library more useful. This library started off as a simple service wrapper around Intercom, but has evolved into a cohesive library of directives and the original wrapper service. We look forward to seeing your contribution!
